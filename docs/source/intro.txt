X-PSI
*****

**A prototype open-source package for neutron star**
**\ X-ray Pulsation Simulation and Inference.**

The initial development of X-PSI was checkpointed with the completion of
:ref:`R19`, and tagged as ``v0.1``. X-PSI remains, however, in the
`initial development stage <https://semver.org/>`_. Backwards incompatible
changes will be committed without incrementing the major version.
The package should not be considered stable, and as such has not been
packaged for automatic installation via a package manager (namely Conda). To
install X-PSI from source, and to install dependencies, see the
:ref:`install` page.

Files for the examples on path ``xpsi/examples`` (i.e., data files,
NICER v1.01 instrument files, sampling files) may be obtained from the
repository owner until they are archived with Zenodo to accompany the paper.

.. note::

    These documentation pages are being rapidly updated during development.

    These pages were generated from a local development build prior to release
    ``v0.2.0``. They are hosted on GitHub due to requests from potential users.
    The pages reference ``v0.1`` that is currently on the ``master`` branch
    of the repo, but do not aim to comprehensively document that version.
