X-PSI
*****

**A prototype open-source package for neutron star**
**\ X-ray Pulsation Simulation and Inference.**

The initial development of X-PSI was checkpointed with the completion of
:ref:`R19`, and tagged as ``v0.1``. X-PSI remains, however, in the
`initial development stage <https://semver.org/>`_. Backwards incompatible
changes will be committed without incrementing the major version.
The package should not be considered stable.
