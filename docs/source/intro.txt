X-PSI
*****

**An open-source package for neutron star**
**\ X-ray Pulse Simulation and Inference.**

X-PSI is designed to simulate rotationally-modified (pulsed) surface X-ray
emission from neutron stars, taking into account relativistic effects on
the emitted radiation.  This can then be used to perform Bayesian statistical
inference on real or simulated astronomical data sets.  Model parameters of
interest may include neutron star mass and radius (useful to constrain the
properties of ultradense nuclear matter) or the system geometry and properties
of the hot emitting regions.  To achieve this, X-PSI couples code for
likelihood function evaluation (simulation) with existing open-source software
for posterior sampling (inference)


Concept
*******

The video below, generated by X-PSI, shows a neutron star with non-uniform
surface temperature, as it rotates. In this specific case the star hosts a
photospheric radiation field whose asymmetry is driven by an underlying
ocean wave (a buoyant :math:`r`-mode) of thermonuclear burning. The wave is
effectively periodic over a small number of rotational cycles. The simulation
was generated by feeding a wave solution, computed by Frank Chambers
(University of Amsterdam),\ [#]_ in the form of a field of temperatures in
surface local-comoving frames (:math:`\sim\! 10^{6}\,\mathrm{K}`), to X-PSI
for photospheric imaging. A number of simplifying assumptions are made in mode
calculation and imaging, but this serves to illustrate the simulation and
visualisation of a neutron star that pulses in the X-ray regime due to
rotational modulation of some mode of radiative asymmetry at the surface.

Each panel displays a specific photon intensity sky map. Panels from top-left to
bottom-right increase in photon energy. The intensity field in each panel is
uniquely normalised to the maximum intensity over all phases and sky
directions. The remarkable evolution of the image with photon energy is
due to relativistic beaming: at energies much greater than the characteristic
temperature, the contribution to the image is entirely dominated by the hottest
region of the surface being relativistically beamed toward the observer as it
approaches on the left-side of the star. This is the same effect seen in
many other astrophysical simulations, particularly of images of (supermassive)
accreting black holes (for instance by the Event Horizon Telescope
collaboration), although it was interestingly omitted from the motion picture
film *Interstellar*.\ [#]_

The following image integrates (and thus averages) over waveband (a
range of photon energies). We also decrease the mode frequency relative to the
stellar spin frequency, such that the mode is not as equatorially trapped.\ [#]_

If one integrates over solid angle (i.e., over sky directions), one is left
with a specific photon flux in a joint space of photon energy and time (i.e.,
rotational phase). This is natural because galactic neutron stars subtend far
too small a solid angle on the sky to be spatially resolved by any telescope:
they are point sources. We must nevertheless account for the variation of
intensity with sky direction if we are to compute the data-generating process.
If one then integrates over phase, the phase-averaged spectrum of photons
incident on a telescope is yielded; if one instead integrates over some
waveband, a photon pulse-profile is yielded. The following displays
several cycles of a phase-energy resolved pulse-profile generated by the more
equatorially trapped, :math:`r`-mode rendered above.

The integration over energy is, for likelihood function evaluation, modified
by a kernel for the response of an X-ray telescope to the incident radiation
field.

.. [#] There are a number of visualisation possibilities. For instance, we
       could average the image(s) over phase and/or energy to yield a single
       static image; we could plot phase evolution in one spatial dimension
       (with energy variation in the second) or two spatial dimensions
       (perhaps with energy dependence rendered in time). We could also render
       in space and/or time, variation of the images with stellar parameters
       such as gravitational mass, and geometric parameters such as observer
       inclination to the stellar rotation axis. We could plot
       an image evolving in time, with other panels rendering a photon
       specrum and a pulse-profile evolving in time with the image; here is
       an `example <https://youtu.be/by3_6rWE7po>`_.

A JOSS paper is being drafted for the first major release.
The technical notes in the repository on path ``/docs/technical`` will be
updated and made available on the arXiv in the future. The first version of a
subset of these technical notes appeared in a PhD thesis which you could cite
if you wish to cite a published work in the meantime:

.. code-block:: latex

   @phdthesis{riley19,
       author = {{Riley}, Thomas E.},
       title = "{Neutron star parameter estimation from a NICER perspective}",
       school = {University of Amsterdam},
       year = 2019,
       address = {https://hdl.handle.net/11245.1/aa86fcf3-2437-4bc2-810e-cf9f30a98f7a},
       month = 12
   }

In the interest of openness, these notes were submitted to a journal. However,
a subset of revisions suggested by the referee are not something we are willing
to spend time on at present; we are instead working on these documentation pages
hosted on GitHub (as required by the referee) and developing the package further
whilst applying it in research applications. Submisssion of these technical
notes to a journal was arguably premature; on the other hand, it may never be
worth the time investment over posting to the arXiv and updating as appropriate.


State of development
********************

The targeted release for the first major version of X-PSI is September 2020.

The initial development of X-PSI was checkpointed with the completion of
:ref:`R19`, and tagged as ``v0.1``. X-PSI remains, however, in the
`initial development stage <https://semver.org/>`_. Backwards incompatible
changes will be committed without incrementing the major version.
The package should not be considered stable, and as such has not been
packaged for automatic installation via a package manager (namely Conda). To
install X-PSI from source, and to install dependencies, see the
:ref:`install` page.

.. note::

    These documentation pages are being rapidly updated during development.

    These pages were generated from a local development build.
    The pages often reference ``v0.1`` that is tagged on the ``master``
    branch of the repo, but that version is not explicitly documented.

The tutorials and examples in these documentation pages however, use
``v0.5`` of X-PSI. The required files (i.e., data files and NICER v1.01
instrument files) may be obtained from a different repository due to file size
considerations:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ThomasEdwardRiley/xpsi_workshop.git </path/to/clone>

This repository also contains unexecuted tutorial notebooks with less
verbosity if this is preferred. Refer to the repository README for instructions
regarding large files.

Other examples may be found on path ``xpsi/examples``. Note, however, that these
examples used ``v0.1`` of X-PSI, which can be checked out via the tag on the
``master`` branch. Eventually, example files will be archived with Zenodo
to accompany a JOSS paper. Moreover, the examples require cluster usage and will
have to be updated for release of the first major version of X-PSI.
