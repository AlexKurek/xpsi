X-PSI
*****

**A prototype open-source package for neutron star**
**\ X-ray Pulsation Simulation and Inference.**

The initial development of X-PSI was checkpointed with the completion of
:ref:`R19`, and tagged as ``v0.1``. X-PSI remains, however, in the
`initial development stage <https://semver.org/>`_. Backwards incompatible
changes will be committed without incrementing the major version.
The package should not be considered stable, and as such has not been
packaged for automatic installation via a package manager (namely Conda). To
install X-PSI from source, and to install dependencies, see the
:ref:`install` page.

.. note::

    These documentation pages are being rapidly updated during development.

    These pages were generated from a local development build prior to release
    ``v0.3``. The pages often reference ``v0.1`` that is tagged on the
    ``master`` branch of the repo, but that version is not explicitly
    documented.

The *Modelling* and *Hot region complexity* tutorials in these
documentation pages however, use ``v0.3`` of X-PSI. The required files
(i.e., data files and NICER v1.01 instrument files) may be obtained from a
different repository due to file size considerations:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ThomasEdwardRiley/xpsi_workshop.git </path/to/clone>

This repository also contains unexecuted tutorial notebooks with less
verbosity if this is preferred.

Other examples may be found on path ``xpsi/examples``. Note, however, that these
examples used ``v0.1`` of X-PSI, which can be checked out via the tag on the
``master`` branch. Eventually, example files will be archived with Zenodo
to accompany the paper.
