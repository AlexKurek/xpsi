Contributing
------------

We outline below the workflow we use for developing X-PSI.

Contact
~~~~~~~

You can interact with the X-PSI :ref:`team` in the public domain on GitHub.
We may also be contacted privately at xpsi-team[at]googlegroups.com.
Private development between releases is performed in a private repository on
BitBucket. We communicate internally in our Slack workspace.

To contribute to this project you can do so whilst being recognised as either
a community member or a team member. If you contribute to feature development
publicly on GitHub, you will be invited to be recognised as a team member in
the :ref:`acknowledgments`, and to join the mailing group and our Slack
workspace.

Community members can request to join our Slack workspace without being
recognised as a team member (or developing features). Community members who
are experienced users and are willing to donate some of their time to assisting
other X-PSI users (the potential benefits of engaging in such interaction are
self-explanatory) may also request to join the X-PSI team without developing
features.

Past developers are recognised as team members unless they no longer wish to be.
Aside from acknowledging your contribution, this is useful for feature
maintenance and a contact point for questions, if permission is granted.
Past team members will be acknowledged as such.

If you are a grant-holder and wish to base a major research project on the
application and/or development of X-PSI, please contact Anna L. Watts, whose
contact details are on the :ref:`acknowledgements` page.
