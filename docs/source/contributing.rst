Contributing
------------

We outline below the workflow we use for developing X-PSI.

Contact
~~~~~~~

You can interact with the X-PSI :ref:`team` in the public domain on GitHub.
We may also be contacted privately at *xpsi-team[at]googlegroups.com*.
Private development between releases is performed in a private repository on
BitBucket. We communicate internally in our Slack workspace.

To contribute to this project you can do so whilst being recognised as either
a community member or a team member. If you contribute to feature development
publicly on GitHub, you will be invited to be recognised as a team member in
the :ref:`acknowledgements`, and to join the mailing group and our Slack
workspace.

Community members can request to join our Slack workspace without being
recognised as a team member (or developing features). Community members who
are experienced users and are willing to donate some of their time to assisting
other X-PSI users (the potential benefits of engaging in such interaction are
self-explanatory) may also request to join the X-PSI team without developing
features.

Past developers are recognised as team members unless they no longer wish to be.
Aside from acknowledging your contribution, this is useful for feature
maintenance and a contact point for questions, if permission is granted.
Past team members will be acknowledged as such.

If you are a grant-holder and wish to base a major research project on the
development and/or application of X-PSI, we would like to invite you to discuss
your joining the X-PSI team in order to collaborate. If you find this idea
interesting then please contact Anna L. Watts, whose contact details are on the
:ref:`acknowledgements` page. You are entirely free to develop X-PSI only in the
public domain on GitHub, of course, but we can likely better organise and
execute this work by using a mixture of private and public platforms. If you
are applying X-PSI in research as an end-user, a private plaform for
communication is probably desirable, and we invite you to request access to our
Slack workspace.

Git workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**GitHub repository**

X-PSI is an open-source software project and we aspire that all X-PSI versions
required for reproducibility of publications have release tags on GitHub.

End-users and community contributors can interact with the project freely on
GitHub. If you wish to contribute code, either in the form of a patch, a tweak,
or a feature, but are uncertain about the workflow, we now provide guidelines.



If you want to contribute a feature, you are welcome to communicate with us
either on GitHub via issues and pull-requests, or on a private platform
(see below).


**BitBucket repository**

Most feature development by the X-PSI team is conducted on private platforms
including a private development repository.
