The script called ``examples/examples_fast/Modules/main.py`` is a quick test run not requiring any input files. It assumes a single hot region with a uniform temperature using the default blackbody atmosphere extension and a fake instrument matrix.

Another script called ``examples/examples_modeling_tutorial/TestRun_BB.py`` is test run, which similar to the :doc:`Modeling<Modeling>` tutorial, requiring the same input files as in the corresponding tutorial and using the default blackbody atmosphere extension.

Third script called ``examples/examples_modeling_tutorial/TestRun_Num.py`` is also test run, which similar to the :doc:`Modeling<Modeling>` tutorial, except using the numerical atmosphere extension.
